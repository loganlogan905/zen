Hello! Welcome to the Zen GitHub repository.
Every release in Alpha and possibly Beta will be formatted in .zip files, and everything else will be on the World Wide Web!

Alpha 1.00 is the first release. It is the bare bones of what it will look like.

The Zen Development Team is pleased to announce that NO ACCOUNTS WILL BE NEEDED! Zen is completely free to use for everyone!

Thank you for following this project and we hope it helps organize your life!

Sincerely,
The Zen Development Team
